Introduction
============

This library eases interacting with debug peripherals in an ARM processor including CoreSight
components. We focus on the embedded trace buffer (ETB) and micro trace buffer (MTB) to make trace
debugging more accessible.

Usage Example
=============

For now, from within ``gdb``:

.. code-block:: shell

    source coresight.py
